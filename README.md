## App Brainstorming

My Favorite Apps: 

1. TikTok
   - great customized algorithm
   - a one-stop shop for entertainment, information, and e-commerce
   - ability to connect and share with anyone anywhere as long as they have an active account
     
2. Tomb of The Mask
   - a fun modern stratgey game with a nostalgic design
   - opportunities to play mini games that allow you to collect coins and gems if tired of playing the main game
   - the mini games and main games build off of one another to make your character better
  
3. Letterboxd
   - allows users to connect, share, and rate various films (social media for movies)
   - you can make lists of what you have and want to watch
   - can customize and group different movies together based on users reccomedations
   - depending on the movie, there may be graphics displayed that coincide with it
   -   (ex.) After clicking "Watched" for _Everything Everywhere All at Once_, a graphic of a google eye pops up. 
   

New App Idea: iMessage Update

I really like the customization of Instagram DMs and would like to implement more customization ideas for iMessage to. Phones used to be completely customizable, and I would like to have that ability with my iPhone.
